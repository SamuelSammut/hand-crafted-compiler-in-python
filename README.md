# How to use
When you open the program, go to the `code.par` file. This file takes the input Par code. I have readied a number of different code snippets that I used in the documentation to try them out. They are located in the examples folder.

Simply paste the examples in the code.par file, then go to the `run.py` file and run it. Note that the different modules of the compiler are present here, and one can comment out the various parts to test a specific module. The instructions or any output from the different modules will be printed in the console
